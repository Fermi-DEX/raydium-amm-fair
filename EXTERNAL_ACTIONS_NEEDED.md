# External Actions Needed for Full Testing

## Summary
The Continuum FIFO wrapper is fully implemented and deployed on devnet. We've created comprehensive pool creation and testing scripts. However, there are a few actions that require external intervention or manual steps:

## 1. Pool Authority Transfer (CRITICAL)
**Status**: ‚ö†Ô∏è Requires External Action

When a new Raydium pool is created, it's initialized with Raydium's default authority PDA. For the FIFO wrapper to work correctly and prevent bypass, the pool authority must be transferred to the Continuum wrapper.

### What's Needed:
- Transfer pool authority from Raydium's default PDA to Continuum's pool authority PDA
- This typically requires calling a special admin instruction on the Raydium program
- Without this, swaps through the wrapper will fail with authority errors

### Current State:
- Continuum pool authority PDA is initialized and ready
- Pool is created with standard Raydium authority
- Swaps will fail with custom error 0x30 (48) until authority is transferred

## 2. Wallet Funding
**Status**: ‚úÖ Can be done in sandbox

For testing on devnet, you need SOL for transaction fees:
```bash
solana airdrop 2 --url devnet --keypair test-wallet-devnet.json
```

Note: Devnet airdrops are sometimes unreliable. If they fail, you may need to:
- Try multiple times
- Use a devnet faucet website
- Get devnet SOL from another source

## 3. Running the Scripts
**Status**: ‚úÖ Ready to run

### Create a new pool with tokens:
```bash
cd sdk
npx ts-node scripts/create-continuum-pool-complete.ts
```

This will:
- Create two new tokens (CFAIR and CFIFO)
- Mint 1M of each token
- Create a Raydium pool with 100k/100k liquidity
- Initialize Continuum pool authority
- Update relayer configuration

### Test swapping:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/test-continuum-swap-complete.ts
```

This will attempt to swap through the wrapper. It will likely fail with authority errors until step 1 is completed.

### Monitor FIFO queue:
```bash
npx ts-node scripts/examples/monitor-fifo.ts
```

## 4. Pool Authority Transfer Methods

### Option A: Admin Transfer (Requires Raydium Admin)
If Raydium has an admin transfer function, the pool admin would need to call it to transfer authority to the Continuum PDA.

### Option B: Wrapper-Owned Pools
Create pools where the wrapper is the initial owner. This requires modifying the pool creation process to use a PDA as the authority from the start.

### Option C: Modified Raydium Fork
Deploy a modified version of Raydium that allows authority transfer or uses Continuum as the default authority.

## 5. Production Deployment
**Status**: üîÆ Future Work

For mainnet deployment:
1. Audit the smart contracts
2. Set up proper key management
3. Configure production RPC endpoints
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Create user documentation
6. Build a frontend interface

## Current Testing Limitations

Without pool authority transfer, you can still test:
- ‚úÖ FIFO sequence enforcement
- ‚úÖ Wrapper transaction building
- ‚úÖ SDK functionality
- ‚úÖ Relayer operation
- ‚ùå Actual swap execution (will fail at CPI)

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run `create-continuum-pool-complete.ts` to create a test pool
2. **Research**: Investigate Raydium's authority transfer mechanisms
3. **Alternative**: Consider creating a mock pool program for full end-to-end testing
4. **Long-term**: Plan for production deployment with proper authority management
